Pjs-2D-Game-Engine
==================

This project is a processingjs based game called "Mario Fight Mountain Boss". It is based on the 
Pomax's Pjs-2D-Game-Engine project from https://github.com/Pomax/Pjs-2D-Game-Engine. In this fork, 
I create a new scene where Mario tries to beat a boss that throws mountains to him. The game is 
fun for children whether they have played wii mario or not. The project is hosted on heroku at 
http://stormy-escarpment-1620.herokuapp.com, you are welcome to give it a try. Note that the game 
is only tested under Chrome. A sample play of this game is at http://www.screencast.com/t/fIwls1Vwpn9G.
